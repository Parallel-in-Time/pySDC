Figures for the manuscript
--------------------------

See the `scripts` folder, all python scripts have the `fig0[...]` prefix, and each script generate several figures 
from the manuscript.
One can run everything with the `run.sh` script, and crop the pdf figures to the format used in the manuscript with the `crop.sh` script.

Experimental scripts
--------------------

For several problem `probName`, there is two scripts :

- `{probName}_setup.py` : runs the problem with specific parameters and one given SDC configuration
- `{probName}_accuracy.py` : generate error vs dt and error vs cost figures for different SDC configurations

In addition, there is those generic scripts for analysis :

- `convergence.py` : generate convergence graph for specific SDC configurations, using Dahlquist
- `nilpotency.py` : look at nilpotency of stiff and non-stiff limit of the SDC iteration matrix
- `stability.py` : generate stability contours for specific SDC configurations

Finally, all those scripts use the utility module `utils.py`.

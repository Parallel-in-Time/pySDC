    "Building your own sweeper\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "While pySDC comes with a lot of functionality, its purpose is to be extendable and (in a sense) modular.\n",
    "Users are able to replace nearly all key functionality with their own approaches.\n",
    "One particular aspect of this are custom sweepers.\n",
    "In this example, we will look at sweepers that enable parallelism across the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sweeper in pySDC takes values $u_m$ at the nodes and updates them using the SDC iteration rule to get $u_{m+1}$, using the particular type of $Q_\\Delta$ (and of course the scheme itself, be it IMEX, implicit, velocity-verlet and so on).\n",
    "The sweeper is also responsible for computing the residual on a time-step and for getting the final value $u_{\\textrm{end}}$ at the right boundary of the interval.\n",
    "It also provides the mechanism to integrate over the nodes using the $Q$-matrix and it can set an initial guess for each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look briefly into the maths of the project we have set our minds to.\n",
    "Recall that SDC solves fully implicit Runge-Kutta rules that arise from discretizing the integral version of an initial value problem using a quadrature rule:\n",
    "$$u(t_0+\\Delta t) = \\int_{t_0}^{t_0 + \\Delta t} f(u(t), t) dt + u(t_0) \\rightarrow \\vec{u} = \\Delta t QF(\\vec{u}, \\vec{t}) + \\vec{u}_0.$$\n",
    "The matrix $Q$ carries the quadrature weights, the vector $u$ contains the solutions at the quadrature nodes $\\vec{t}$ (which go from 0 to 1), $F$ is some vector valued operator that evaluates the right hand side at the collocation nodes and $\\vec{u}$ carries the initial conditions in every component.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q$ is typically dense, which makes solving this directly prohibitively expensive.\n",
    "SDC alleviates this by introducing iterations and a preconditioner.\n",
    "The result is\n",
    "$$(I - \\Delta t Q_\\Delta F)(\\vec{u}^{k+1}) = \\vec{u}_0 + \\Delta t(Q-Q_\\Delta)F(\\vec{u}^k),$$\n",
    "with $Q_\\Delta$ the preconditioner and $k$ the iteration number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we can solve each iteration by forward substitution because we choose a lower triangular preconditioner.\n",
    "Looking equation component wise, we sweep through the collocation nodes by perform the following \"implicit Euler\" steps:\n",
    "$$u^{k+1}_{m+1} - \\Delta t \\tilde{q}_{m+1, m+1}f(u^{k+1}_{m+1}) = u_0 + \\Delta t \\sum^m_{j=1}\\tilde{q}_{m+1, j}f(u^{k+1}_j) + \\Delta t \\sum^M_{j=1}(q_{m+1, j} - \\tilde{q}_{m+1, j})f(u^{k}_j),$$\n",
    "with $m$ the index of the current collocation node and $M$ the number of collocation nodes.\n",
    "The first part of the right hand side after the initial conditions is the forward subsitituion part which depends on the current iteration at previous collocation nodes.\n",
    "Everything else on the right hand side depends only on the previous iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means if we can eliminate that part, we can update the solutions at the nodes in parallel!\n",
    "This would be nice because it would allow us to parallelize the right hand side evaluations and the \"implicit Euler\" steps across the collocation nodes, which make for the bulk of computation time in SDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this part comes from the preconditioner, so the natural thing to do is select a different preconditiner.\n",
    "We get rid of the forward subsitution term by using one that is not just lower triangular, but diagonal.\n",
    "Lucky for us, [someone has looked into this a bit already](https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/849786/files/Paper.pdf), but generating good diagonal preconditioners is still an active area of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now write a sweeper that uses MPI to indeed parallelize SDC with diagonal preconditioners over $M$ processes.\n",
    "For computing the residual or for integrating over the nodes, communication over the nodes is needed. Note that we will not deal with all the details here, no error checking, no ideal memory layout etc. to keep the example short."

Step-1: A first spatial problem
===============================

In this step, we create a spatial problem and play with it a little bit.
No SDC, no multi-level here so far.

Part A: Spatial problem setup
-----------------------------

We start as simple as possible by creating a first, very simple problem
using one of the ``problem_classes``, namely ``HeatEquation_1D_FD``.
This basically consists only of the matrix ``A``, which represents a
finite difference discretization of the 1D Laplacian. This is tested for
one particular example.

Important things to note:

-  Many (most) parameters for pySDC are passed using dictionaries
-  Data types are encapsulated: the real values are stored in
   ``values``, meta-information can be stored separately in the data
   structure
-  A quick peak into ``HeatEquation_1D_FD`` reveals that the ``init``
   and the ``params.nvars`` attribute contain the same values (namely
   ``nvars``). Yet, sometimes one or the other is used here (and
   throughout the code). The reason is this: the data structure
   (``mesh`` in this case) needs some form of standard initialization.
   For this, pySDC uses the ``init`` attribute each problem class has.
   In our simple example, this is he same as ``nvars``, but e.g. for
   Finite Elements, the function space is stored in the ``init``
   attribute. Thus, whenever a data type is created, use ``init``,
   otherwise do whatever looks nice.
-  We happily pass classes around so that they can be used to
   instantiate things within subroutines

Part B: Spatial accuracy check
------------------------------

We now do a more thorough test of the accuracy of the spatial
discretization. We loop over a set of ``nvars``, compute the Laplacian
of our test vector and look at the error. Then, the order of accuracy in
space is checked by looking at the numbers and by looking at "points on a line".

Important things to note:

-  You better test your operators.. use nvars > 2\*\*16 and things will
   break!
-  Add your results into a dictionary for later usage. Use IDs to find
   the data! Also, use headers to store meta-information.

Part C: Collocation problem setup
---------------------------------

Here, we set up our first collocation problem using one of the
``collocation_classes``, namely ``GaussRadau_Right``. Using the spatial
operator, we can build the **collocation problem** which in this case is
linear. This fully coupled system is then solved directly and the error
is compared to the exact solution.

Important things to note:

-  The collocation matrix ``Q`` is and will be always relative to the
   temporal domain [0,1]. Use ``dt`` to scale it appropriately.
-  Although convenient to analyze, the matrix formulation is not suited
   for larger (in space or time) computations. All remaining
   computations in pySDC are thus based on decoupling space and time
   operators (i.e. no Kronecker product).
-  We can use the ``u_exact`` routine here to return the values at any
   given point in time. It is recommended to include either an
   initialization routine or the exact solution (if applicable) into the
   problem class.
-  This is where the fun with parameters comes in: How many DOFs do we
   need in space? How large/small does dt have to be? What frequency in
   space is fine? ...

Part D: Collocation accuracy test
---------------------------------

As for the spatial operator, we now test the accuracy in time. This
time, we loop over a set of ``dt``, compute the solution to the
collocation problem and look at the error.

Important things to note:

-  We take a large number of DOFs in space, since we need to beat 5th
   order in time with a 2nd order stencil in space.
-  Orders of convergence are not as stable as for the space-only test.
   One of the problems of this example is that we are actually trying to
   compute 0 very, very thorougly...

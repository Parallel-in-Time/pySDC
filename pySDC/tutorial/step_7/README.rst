Step-7: pySDC with external libraries
=====================================

pySDC can be used with external libraries, in particular for spatial discretization, parallelization and solving of linear and/or nonlinear systems.
In the following, we show a few examples of pySDC + X.

Part A: pySDC and FEniCS
------------------------

In this example, pySDC is coupled with the `FEniCS framework <https://fenicsproject.org/>`_ for using finite elements in space.
This implies significant changes to the algorithm, depending on whether or not the mass matrix should be inverted.
SDC, MLSDC and PFASST can be used without changes when the right-hand side of the ODE is defined with the inverse of the mass matrix.
Otherwise, the mass matrix has to be used for e.g. the tau-correction.
This example tests different variants of this methodology for SDC, MLSDC and PFASST.

Important things to note:

- This example shows that even core routines like the `BaseTransfer` can be overwritten if needed.
- It is also valuable to check out the data type and transfer classes required to work with FEniCS. Both can be found in the `implementations` folder.

Part B: mpi4py-fft for parallel Fourier transforms
--------------------------------------------------

The most prominent parallel solver is, probably, the FFT.
While many implementations or wrappers for Python exist, we decided to use `mpi4py-fft <https://mpi4py-fft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, which provided the easiest installation, a simple API and good parallel scaling.
As an example, we here test the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, using the IMEX sweeper to treat the nonlinear parts explicitly.
The code allows to work both in real and spectral space, while the latter is usually faster.
This example tests SDC, MLSDC and PFASST.

Important things to note:

- The code runs both in serial using just `python B_pySDC_with_mpi4pyfft.py` and also in parallel using `mpirun -np 2 python B_pySDC_with_mpi4pyfft.py`.
- The nonlinear Schrödinger example is not expected to work well with PFASST. In fact, SDC and MLSDC converge for larger time-steps, but PFASST does not.

Part C: Time-parallel pySDC with space-parallel PETSc
-----------------------------------------------------

With rather unfavorable scaling properties, parallel-in-time methods are only really useful when spatial parallelization is maxed out.
To work with spatial parallelization, this part shows how to (1) include and work with an external library and (2) set up space- and time-parallel runs.
We use again the forced heat equation as our testbed and `PETSc <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/>`_ for the space-parallel data structures and linear solver.
See `implementations/datatype_classes/petsc_dmda_grid.py` and `implementations/problem_classes/HeatEquation_2D_PETSc_forced.py` for details on the PETSc bindings.

Important things to note:

- We need processors in space and time, which can be achieved by `comm.Split` and coloring. The space-communicator is then passed to the problem class.
- Below, we run the code 3 times: with 1 and 2 processors in space as well as 4 processors (2 in time and 2 in space). Do not expect scaling due to the CI environment.

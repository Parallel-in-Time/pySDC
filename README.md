# Welcome to pySDC!

The `pySDC` project is a Python implementation of the
spectral deferred correction (SDC) approach and its flavors, esp. the
multilevel extension MLSDC and PFASST. It is intended for rapid
prototyping and educational purposes. New ideas like e.g. sweepers or
predictors can be tested and first toy problems can be easily
implemented.

## Features

-   Variants of SDC: explicit, implicit, IMEX, multi-implicit, Verlet,
    multi-level, diagonal, multi-step
-   Variants of PFASST: virtual parallel or MPI-based parallel,
    classical of multigrid perspective
-   8 tutorials: from setting up a first collocation problem to SDC,
    PFASST and advanced topics
-   Projects: many documented projects with defined and tested outcomes
-   Many different examples, collocation types, data types already
    implemented
-   Works with [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/),
    [mpi4py-fft](https://mpi4py-fft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
    [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) (through
    [petsc4py](https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py))
-   Continuous integration via [GitHub
    Actions](https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC/actions) and
    [Gitlab CI](https://gitlab.hzdr.de/r.speck/pysdc/-/pipelines)
-   Fully compatible with Python 3.7 - 3.10, runs at least on Ubuntu and
    MacOS

## Getting started

The code is hosted on GitHub, see
<https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC>, and PyPI, see
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pySDC>. While using `pip install pySDC`
will give you a core version of `pySDC` to work with,
working with the developer version is most often the better choice. We
thus recommend to checkout the code from GitHub and install the
dependencies e.g. by using a [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/)
environment. For this, `pySDC` ships with environment files
which can be found in the folder `etc/`. Use these as e.g.

``` bash
conda env create -f etc/environment-base.yml
```

To check your installation, run

``` bash
pytest pySDC/tests -m NAME
```

where `NAME` corresponds to the environment you chose (`base` in the
example above). You may need to update your `PYTHONPATH` by running

``` bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/pySDC/root/folder
```

in particular if you want to run any of the playgrounds, projects or
tutorials. All `import` statements there assume that the
`pySDC`\'s base directory is part of `PYTHONPATH`.

For many examples, `LaTeX` is used for the plots, i.e. a
decent installation of this is needed in order to run those examples.
When using `fenics` or `petsc4py`, a C++
compiler is required (although installation may go through at first).

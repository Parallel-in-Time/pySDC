How to contribute to pySDC
==========================

Developments on the ``pySDC`` code use the classical approach of forks and pull requests.
You can look at `extended GitHub documentation <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models>`_ for more details (skip this if you are already used to it). Furthermore, branches on ``pySDC`` follow a pre-defined structure. To contribute to any of them, please look at the :doc:`pull request recommendations <./docs/contrib/01_pull_requests>`.

Additionally, a *few* rules are set to enforce code readability, consistency and reliability. Some of them are automatically tested with each commit, and summarized in the page on :doc:`continuous integration (CI) <./docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration>`.
Others are specific conventions chosen for the pySDC library, that may follow Python standards (or not ...), detailed in the :doc:`naming conventions <./docs/contrib/03_naming_conventions>` page.

Finally, while ``pySDC`` provides many base functionalities that implement classical flavors of SDC, it also allows problem-specific applications through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the implementation of custom inherited classes.
This follows a specific OOP framework, you can look at the page on :doc:`custom implementations <./docs/contrib/04_custom_implementations>` for more details.

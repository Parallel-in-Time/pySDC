Continuous Integration in pySDC
===============================

Any commit in ``pySDC`` are tested by GitHub continuous integration (CI). You can see in in the `action panel <https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC/actions>`_ the tests for each branches.
Those tests are currently divided in three main categories : :ref:`code linting <docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration/code-linting>`\ , :ref:`code testing <docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration/code-testing>` and :ref:`code coverage <docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration/code-coverage>`.
Finally, the CI also build artifacts that are used to generate the documentation website (see http://parallel-in-time.org/pySDC/), more details given in the :ref:`documentation generation <docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration/documentation-generation>` section.

.. _docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration/code-linting:

Code linting
------------

Code style linting is performed using `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and `flakeheaven <https://flakeheaven.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for code syntax checking. In particular, ``black`` is used to check compliance with (most of) `PEP-8 guidelines <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_.

Those tests are conducted for each commit (even for forks), but you can also run it locally in the root folder of ``pySDC`` before pushing any commit :

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install required packages (works also with conda/mamba)
   pip install black flakeheaven flake8-comprehensions flake8-bugbear
   # First : test code style linting with black
   black pySDC --check --diff --color
   # Second : test code syntax with flakeheaven
   flakeheaven lint --benchmark pySDC

..

   |:bell:| To avoid any error about formatting (\ ``black``\ ), you can simply use this program to reformat directly your code using the command :

   .. code-block:: bash

      black pySDC


Some style rules that are automatically enforced :


* lines should be not longer than 120 characters
* arithmetic operators (\ ``+``\ , ``*``\ , ...) should be separated with variables by one empty space

.. _docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration/code-testing:

Code testing
------------

This is done using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/>`_\ , and runs all the tests written in the ``pySDC/tests`` folder. You can run those locally in the root folder of ``pySDC`` using :

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install required packages (works also with conda/mamba)
   pip install pytest<7.2.0 pytest-benchmark coverage[toml]
   # Run tests
   pytest -v pySDC/tests

..

   |:bell:| Many components are tested (core, implementations, projects, tutorials, etc ...) which make the testing quite long.
   When working on a single part of the code, you can run only the corresponding part of the test by specifying the test path, for instance :

   .. code-block:: bash

      pytest -v pySDC/tests/test_nodes.py  # only test nodes generation


.. _docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration/code-coverage:

Code coverage
-------------

This stage allows to checks how much of the ``pySDC`` code is tested by the previous stage. It is based on the `coverage <https://pypi.org/project/coverage/>`_ library and currently applied to the following directories :


* ``pySDC/core``
* ``pySDC/projects``
* ``pySDC/tutorial``

This analysis is done in parallel to the test each time a pull is done on any branch (main repository or fork). 
You can look at the current coverage report for the master branch `here <https://parallel-in-time.org/pySDC/coverage/index.html>`_ or compare the results with previous builds `here <https://app.codecov.io/gh/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC>`_. Codecov will also comment on any pull request, indicating the change of coverage.

During developments, you can also run the coverage tests locally, using :

.. code-block:: bash

   echo "print('Loading sitecustomize.py...');import coverage;coverage.process_startup()" > sitecustomize.py
   coverage run -m pytest --continue-on-collection-errors -v --durations=0 pySDC/tests

..

   |:bell:| Note that this will run all ``pySDC`` tests while analyzing coverage, hence requires all packages installed for the :ref:`code testing stage <docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration/code-testing>`.


Once the test are finished, you can collect and post-process coverage result :

.. code-block:: bash

   coverage combine
   python -m coverage html

This will generate the coverage report in a ``htmlcov`` folder, and you can open the ``index.html`` file within using your favorite browser.

..

   |:warning:| Coverage can be lower if some tests fails (for instance, if you did not install all required python package to run all the tests).


.. _docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration/coverage-exceptions:

Coverage exceptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some types of code lines will be ignored by the coverage analysis (\ *e.g* lines starting with ``raise``\ , ...), see the ``[tool.coverage.report]`` section in ``pyproject.toml``.
Part of code (functions, conditionaly, for loops, etc ...) can be ignored by coverage analysis using the ``# pragma: no cover``\ , for instance 

.. code-block:: python

   # ...
   # code analyzed by coverage
   # ...
   # pragma: no cover
   if condition:
       # code ignored by coverage
   # ...
   # code analyzed by coverage
   # ...
   # pragma: no cover
   def function():
       # all function code is ignored by coverage

Accepted use of the ``# pragma: no cover`` are:


#. Functions and code used for plotting
#. Lines in one conditional preceding any ``raise`` statement

If you think the pragma should be used in other parts of your pull request, please indicate (and justify) this in your description.

.. _docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration/documentation-generation:

Documentation generation
------------------------

Documentation is built using `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_.
To check its generation, you can wait for all the CI tasks to download the ``docs`` artifacts, unzip it and open the ``index.html`` file there with you favorite browser. 

However, when you are working on documentation (of the project, of the code, etc ...), you can already build and check the website locally :

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run all tests, continuing even with errors
   pytest --continue-on-collection-errors -v --durations=0 pySDC/tests
   # Generate rst files for sphinx
   ./docs/update_apidocs.sh
   # Generate html documentation
   sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build/html

Then you can open ``docs/build/html/index.html`` using you favorite browser and check how your own documentation looks like on the website.

..

   |:bell:| **Important** : running all the tests is necessary to generate graphs and images used by the website. 
   But you can still generate the website without it: just all images for the tutorials, projects and playgrounds will be missing.
   This approach can be considered for local testing of your contribution when it does not concern parts containing images (\ *i.e* project or code documentation).

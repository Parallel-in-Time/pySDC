Documenting Code
================

When developing a new class or function, or improving current classes in ``pySDC``\ , adding Python docstring to document the code is important, in particular :


* to help developer understanding how classes and functions work when reading the code
* to help user understanding how classes and functions work when reading the `documentation <https://parallel-in-time.org/pySDC/#api-documentation>`_

``pySDC`` follows the `NumPy Style Python Docstring <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_\ , below is simplified example
for a class and a function :

..

   |:bell:| Don't document the ``init`` function, but rather the class itself. Also describe parameters (given to the ``__init__``\ ) and attributes (stored into the class) separately.

   class LagrangeApproximation(object):
       r"""
       Class approximating any function on a given set of points using barycentric
       Lagrange interpolation.

       Let note :math:`(t_j)_{0\leq j<n}` the set of points, then any scalar
       function :math:`f` can be approximated by the barycentric formula :

       .. math::
           p(x) =
           \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\frac{w_j}{x-x_j}f_j}
           {\displaystyle \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\frac{w_j}{x-x_j}},

       where :math:`f_j=f(t_j)` and

       .. math::
           w_j = \frac{1}{\prod_{k\neq j}(x_j-x_k)}

       are the barycentric weights.
       The theory and implementation is inspired from `this paper <http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/S0036144502417715>`_.

       Parameters
       ----------
       points : list, tuple or np.1darray
           The given interpolation points, no specific scaling, but must be
           ordered in increasing order.

       Attributes
       ----------
       points : np.1darray
           The interpolating points
       weights : np.1darray
           The associated barycentric weights
       """

       def __init__(self, points):
           pass  # Implementation ...

       @property
       def n(self):
           """Number of points"""
           pass  # Implementation ...

       def getInterpolationMatrix(self, times):
           r"""
           Compute the interpolation matrix for a given set of discrete "time"
           points.

           For instance, if we note :math:`\vec{f}` the vector containing the
           :math:`f_j=f(t_j)` values, and :math:`(\tau_m)_{0\leq m<M}`
           the "time" points where to interpolate.
           Then :math:`I[\vec{f}]`, the vector containing the interpolated
           :math:`f(\tau_m)` values, can be obtained using :

           .. math::
               I[\vec{f}] = P_{Inter} \vec{f},

           where :math:`P_{Inter}` is the interpolation matrix returned by this
           method.

           Parameters
           ----------
           times : list-like or np.1darray
               The discrete "time" points where to interpolate the function.

           Returns
           -------
           PInter : np.2darray(M, n)
               The interpolation matrix, with :math:`M` rows (size of the **times**
               parameter) and :math:`n` columns.
           """

<ul>
<li><p>March 24, 2023: Version 5.2 is out and improves the code in multiple directions. The problem class can now define their
parameters explicitly with the constructor, and not with a dictionary (backward compatible, thanks &#64;tlunet). The resilience project
now comes with the quench problem, resulting a collaboration between &#64;brownbaerchen and &#64;eschnaubelt during the
TIME-X Apps Hackathon at USI Lugano. Many of the other changes under the hood prepare <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code> for Version 6.</p></li>
<li><p>January 23, 2023: Version 5.1 brings a lot of changes to the documentation, both on Github and on the website.
We revived the <a class="reference external" href="https://app.codecov.io/gh/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC">codecov</a> connection and started the
<a class="reference external" href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/6909">OpenSFF Best Practices</a> guide.
The hook classes and the way they are handled has changed (without breaking the API, hooray), the battery model
got quite an update and adaptivity plays a more prominent role now. Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brownbaerchen">&#64;brownbaerchen</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tlunet">&#64;tlunet</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lisawim">&#64;lisawim</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>October 7, 2022: Version 5 comes with many changes, both visible and
invisible ones. Some of those break the existing API, but if you are
using tests, you should be fine. Major changes include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>New convergence controllers</strong>: Checking whether a step has
converged can be tricky, so we made separate modules out of
these checks. This makes features like adaptivity easier to
implement. Also, the controllers have been streamlined a bit to
make them more readable/digestible. Thanks to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brownbaerchen">&#64;brownbaerchen</a>!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptivity and error estimators</strong>: SDC now comes with
adaptivity and error estimation, leveraging the new convergence
controllers out of the box. Thanks to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brownbaerchen">&#64;brownbaerchen</a>!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New collocation classes</strong>: We completely rewrote the way
collocation nodes and weights are computed. It is now faster,
more reliable, shorter, better. But: this <strong>breaks the API</strong>,
since the old collocation classes do not exist anymore. The
projects, tutorials, tests and most of the playgrounds have been
adapted, so have a look over there to see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC/commit/01ffabf71a8d71d33b74809271e8ad5a7b03ac5e#diff-adf74297b6c64d320f4da0f1d5528eda6229803a6615baf5d54c418032543681">what to
change</a>.
Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tlunet">&#64;tlunet</a>!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New projects</strong>: Resilience and energy grid simulations are
ready to play with and are waiting for more ideas! We used this
effort to condense and clean up the problem classes a bit,
reducing the number of files and classes with only marginal
differences significantly. This could potentially <strong>break your
code</strong>, too, if you rely on any of those affected ones. Thanks
to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brownbaerchen">&#64;brownbaerchen</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lisawim">&#64;lisawim</a>!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Toward GPU computing</strong>: We included a new data type based on
<a class="reference external" href="https://cupy.dev/">CuPy</a> making GPU computing possible. Thanks
to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/timo2705">&#64;timo2705</a>!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Better testing</strong>: The CI pipeline got a complete overhaul
(again), now enabling simultaneous tests, faster/earlier
linting, benchmarking (at least, in principal), separate
environments and so on. The code is tested under Ubuntu and
MacOS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Better code formatting</strong>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code> now uses
<a class="reference external" href="https://black.readthedocs.io">black</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://flakeheaven.readthedocs.io">flakeheaven</a> for cleaner
source code. After complaints here and there about linting
&quot;errors&quot; the recommended way now is to run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">black</span></code> before
submission.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>December 13, 2021: Version 4.2 brings compatibility with Python 3.9,
including some code cleanup. The CI test suite seems to run faster
now, since sorting out the dependencies is faster. Tested
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba">mamba</a>, which for now makes the
CI pipeline much faster. Also, the CI workflow can now run locally
using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nektos/act">act</a>. We introduced markers
for soem of the tests in preparation of distributed tests on
different platforms. And finally, a LaTeX installation is no longer
needed use plotting (but recommended).</p></li>
<li><p>August 11, 2021: Version 4.1 has some more changes under the hood,
most of them with no significant impact to users. The CI pipeline
has been completely rewritten, porting the code to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github
Actions</a> (away from <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis
CI</a>), to <a class="reference external" href="https://flake8.pycqa.org">flake8</a>
and to <a class="reference external" href="https://pytest.org">pytest</a> (away from
<a class="reference external" href="https://nose.readthedocs.io">nose</a>). One thing that may have an
impact on users is that following the changes made in Version 4.0,
the PETSc data structures are now much easier, removing a lot of
unnecessary boilerplate code.</p></li>
<li><p>May 4, 2021: Long time, no see, but this major release 4.0 marks
some improvements under the hood:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Rewrote ``mesh`` and ``particle`` data type</strong>:
Creation of new arrays for each operation is now avoided by
directly subclassing Numpy's <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ndarray</span></code>. Somewhat faster,
definitively better, less code, future-proof, but also breaking
the API. If you use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code> for your project, make
sure you adapt to the new data types (or don't upgrade).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faster quadrature</strong>: Thanks to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tlunet">tlunet</a> the computation of the
weights is now faster and (even) more reliable. No breaking of
any API here…</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bugfixing and version pushes</strong>: The code should run without
(many) complaints with Python 3.6, 3.7 and potentially above.
Also, the plotting routines have been adapted to work with
recent versions of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not much (yet) and if it were not for the API changes, this
would have been a minor release.</p>
</li>
<li><p>August 30, 2019: Version 3.1 adds many more examples like the
nonlinear Schrödinger equation, more on Gray-Scott and in particular
Allen-Cahn. Those are many implemented using the parallel FFT
library
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py-fft/src/master/">mpi4pi-fft</a>,
which can now be used with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code>. There are now 8
tutorials, where step 7 shows the usage of three external libraries
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code>: mpi4py, FEniCS and petsc4py. The MPI controller has
been improved after performaning a detailed performance analysis
using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p/">Score-P</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.vi-hps.org/Tools/Extrae.html">Extrae</a>. Finally: first
steps towards error/iteration estimators are taken, too.</p></li>
<li><p>February 14, 2019: Released version 3 of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code>. This
release is accompanied by the <strong>ACM TOMS paper</strong>
<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3310410">“pySDC – Prototyping spectral deferred corrections”</a>.
It release contains some breaking changes to the API. In detail:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Dropped Python 2 support</strong>: Starting with this version,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code> relies on Python 3. Various incompabilities
led to inconsistent treatment of dependencies, so that parts of
the code had to use Python 2 while other relied on Python 3 or
could do both. We follow <a class="reference external" href="https://python3statement.org/">A pledge to migrate to Python
3</a> with this decision, as most
prominent dependencies of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code> already do.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unified controllers</strong>: Instead of providing (and maintaining)
four different controllers, this release only has one for
emulated and one for MPI-based time-parallelization
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">controller_nonMPI</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">controller_MPI</span></code>). This should avoid
further confusion and makes the code easier to maintain. Both
controllers use the multigrid perspective for the algorithm
(first exchange data, than compute updates), but the classical
way of determining when to stop locally (each time-step is
stopped when ready, if the previous one is ready, too). The
complete multigrid behavior can be restored using a flag. All
included projects and tutorials have been adapted to this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No more data types in the front-ends</strong>: The redundant use of
data type specifications in the description dictionaries has
been removed. Data types are now declared within each problem
class (more precisely, in the header of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__init__</span></code>-method to
allow inhertiance). All included projects and tutorials have
been adapted to this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Renewed FEniCS support</strong>: This release revives the deprecated
<a class="reference external" href="https://fenicsproject.org/">FEniCS</a> support, now requiring at
least FEniCS 2018.1. The integration is tested using Travis-CI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More consistent handling of local initial conditions</strong>: The
treatment of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">u[0]</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f[0]</span></code> has been fixed and made
consistent throughout the code.</p></li>
<li><p>As usual, many bugs have been discovered and fixed.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>May 23, 3018: Version 2.4 adds support for
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py">petsc4py</a>! You can now use
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/">PETSc</a> data types
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code> ships with DMDA for distributed structured
grids) and parallel solvers right from your examples and problem
classes. There is also a new tutorial (7.C) showing this in a bit
more detail, including communicator splitting for parallelization in
space and time. Warning: in order to get this to work you need to
install petsc4py and mpi4py first! Make sure both use MPICH3
bindings. Downloading <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code> from PyPI does not include
these packages.</p></li>
<li><p>February 8, 2018: Ever got annoyed at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code>'s
incredibly slow setup phase when multiple time-steps are used?
Version 2.3 changes this by copying the data structure of the first
step to all other steps using the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dill">dill
Package</a>. Setup times could be
reduced by 90% and more for certain problems. We also increase the
speed for certain calculations, in particular for the Penning trap
example.</p></li>
<li><p>November 7, 2017: Version 2.2 contains matrix-based versions of
PFASST within the project <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matrixPFASST</span></code>. This involved quite a few
changes in more or less unexpected places, e.g. in the multigrid
controller and the transfer base class. The impact of these changes
on other projects should be negligible, though.</p></li>
<li><p>October 25, 2017: For the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ics.usi.ch/index.php/6th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-methods">6th Workshop on Parallel-in-Time
Integration</a>
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code> has been updated to version 2.1. It is now
available on PyPI - the Python Package Index, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pySDC">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pySDC</a> and can be installed simply by
using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">pySDC</span></code>. Naturally, this release contains a lot of
bugfixes and minor improvements. Most notably, the file structure
has been changed again to meet the standards for Python packaging
(at least a bit).</p></li>
<li><p>November 24, 2016: Released version 2 of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code>. This
release contains major changes to the code and its structure:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Complete redesign of code structure</strong>: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">core</span></code> part of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code> only contains the core modules and classes,
while <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">implementations</span></code> contains the actual implementations
necessary to run something. This now includes separate files for
all collocation classes, as well as a collection of problems,
transfer classes and so on. Most examples have been ported to
either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tutorials</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">playgrounds</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">projects</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduction of tutorials</strong>: We added a tutorial (see below)
to explain many of pySDC's features in a step-by-step fashion.
We start with a simple spatial discretization and collocation
formulations and move step by step to SDC, MLSDC and PFASST. All
tutorials are accompanied by tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New all-inclusive controllers</strong>: Instead of having two PFASST
controllers which could also do SDC and MLSDC (and more), we now
have four generic controllers which can do all these methods,
depending on the input. They are split into two by two class:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MPI</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NonMPI</span></code> for real or virtual
parallelisim as well as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">classic</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">multigrid</span></code> for the standard and multigrid-like
implementation of PFASST and the likes. Initialization has been
simplified a lot, too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collocation-based coarsening</strong> As the standard PFASST
libraries <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/memmett/libpfasst">libpfasst</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/PFASST">PFASST++</a>
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pySDC</span></code> now offers collocation-based coarsening,
i.e. the number of collocation nodes can be reduced during
coarsening. Also, time-step coarsening is in preparation, but
not implemented yet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing and documentation</strong> The core, implementations and
plugin packages and their subpackages are fully documented using
sphinx-apidoc, see below. This documentation as well as this
website are generated automatically using
<a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC">Travis-CI</a>. Most
of the code is supported by tests, mainly realized by using the
tutorial as the test routines with clearly defined results.
Also, projects are accompanied by tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, minor changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Switched to more stable barycentric interpolation for the
quadrature weights</p></li>
<li><p>New collocation class: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EquidistantSpline_Right</span></code>
for spline-based quadrature</p></li>
<li><p>Collocation tests are realized by generators and not by
classes</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-step SDC (aka single-level PFASST) now works as
expected</p></li>
<li><p>Reworked many of the internal structures for consistency and
simplicity</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

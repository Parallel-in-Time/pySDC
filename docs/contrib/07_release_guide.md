# Publishing a new release (for maintainers only!)

## Base conventions

For each version update (a.k.a **releases**), we use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **patch** (from `*.*.{i}` to `*.*.{i+1}`): minor modifications, bugfixes, code reformating, small new features, new projects or playgrounds, new tests
- **minor** (from `*.{i}.*` to `*.{i+1}.0`): addition of new major features, minor code structure changes without too much impact on the API (backward compatible)
- **major** (from `{i}.*.*` to `{i+1}.0.0`): major changes in code structure, design, and API, with changes potentially breaking backward compatibility 

## Release Pipeline

First, create a `new-release` branch (or choose a similar name), either on your fork or on the main `pySDC` repo. Then, on commit:

1. modify the project version number and, if necessary, the list of authors in `pyproject.toml`
2. modify the documentation release number in `docs/source/conf.py`, and the version number for minor and major release. Also, if necessary, adapt the list of authors.
3. modify the version number, release date and, if necessary, the list of authors  in `CITATION.cff`
4. (for minor and major release **only**) add the release description in the `CHANGELOG.md` file, following the level of details you can find there

Commit with the message: `bump version to x.x.x` where `x.x.x` is the new version. 
Then create a pull request, and once all tests passed, you can `Merge and Squash`,
possibly adding your initials as prefix of the final commit message.

> ðŸ”” Don't forget to delete the `new-release` branch both locally and on your fork (or the main repo):

```bash
git push -d origin new-release  # delete on remote
git branch -D new-release       # delete locally
```

Finally, [draft a new release](https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC/releases/new) associated to a new tag 
`v*.*.*` (with `*.*.*` the new version, and the ` + Create new tag: ... on publish` button).
Add a comprehensive summary of the main changes, with appropriate thanks to all the contributors (cf previous releases), and publish it. This will trigger automatically a release update on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.594191).
For uploading the new release on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pySDC/), this is done manually so you'll have to ask [Robert Speck (@pancetta)](https://github.com/pancetta) for support (ideally send him a quick email).

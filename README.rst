Welcome to pySDC!
=================

The `pySDC` project is a Python implementation of the spectral deferred correction (SDC) approach and its flavors,
esp. the multilevel extension MLSDC and PFASST. It is intended for rapid prototyping and educational purposes.
New ideas like e.g. sweepers or predictors can be tested and first toy problems can be easily implemented.


Features
--------

- Variants of SDC: explicit, implicit, IMEX, multi-implicit, Verlet, multi-level, diagonal, multi-step
- Variants of PFASST: virtual parallel or MPI-based parallel, classical of multigrid perspective
- 8 tutorials: from setting up a first collocation problem to SDC, PFASST and advanced topics
- Projects: many documented projects with defined and tested outcomes
- Many different examples, collocation types, data types already implemented
- Works with `FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org/>`_, `mpi4py-fft <https://mpi4py-fft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `PETSc <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/>`_ (through `petsc4py <https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py>`_)
- Continuous integration via `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC/actions>`_ and `Gitlab CI <https://gitlab.hzdr.de/r.speck/pysdc/-/pipelines>`_
- Fully compatible with Python 3.7 - 3.10, runs at least on Ubuntu and MacOS


Getting started
---------------

The code is hosted on GitHub, see `https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC <https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC>`_, and PyPI, see `https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pySDC <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pySDC>`_.
While using ``pip install pySDC`` will give you a core version of `pySDC` to work with, working with the developer version
is most often the better choice. We thus recommend to checkout the code from GitHub and install the dependencies e.g. by using a `conda <https://conda.io/en/latest/>`_ environment.
For this, `pySDC` ships with environment files which can be found in the folder ``etc/``. Use these as e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create --yes -f etc/environment-base.yml

To check your installation, run

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest pySDC/tests -m NAME

where ``NAME`` corresponds to the environment you chose (``base`` in the example above).
You may need to update your ``PYTHONPATH`` by running

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/pySDC/root/folder

in particular if you want to run any of the playgrounds, projects or tutorials.
All ``import`` statements there assume that the `pySDC`'s base directory is part of ``PYTHONPATH``.

For many examples, `LaTeX` is used for the plots, i.e. a decent installation of this is needed in order to run those examples.
When using `fenics` or `petsc4py`, a C++ compiler is required (although installation may go through at first).

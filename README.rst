Welcome to pySDC!
=================

The `pySDC` project is a Python implementation of the spectral deferred correction (SDC) approach and its flavors,
esp. the multilevel extension MLSDC and PFASST. It is intended for rapid prototyping and educational purposes.
New ideas like e.g. sweepers or predictors can be tested and first toy problems can be easily implemented.


Features
--------

- Variants of SDC: explicit, implicit, IMEX, multi-implicit, Verlet, multi-level, diagonal, multi-step
- Variants of PFASST: virtual parallel or MPI-based parallel, classical of multigrid perspective
- 8 tutorials: from setting up a first collocation problem to SDC, PFASST and advanced topics
- Projects: many documented projects with defined and tested outcomes
- Many different examples, collocation types, data types already implemented
- Works with `PETSc <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/>`_ through `petsc4py <https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py>`_ , `FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org/>`_ and `mpi4py-fft <https://mpi4py-fft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- Continuous integration via `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC>`_
- Fully compatible with 3.6 (or higher)


Getting started
---------------

The code is hosted on GitHub, see `https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC <https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC>`_, and PyPI, see `https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pySDC <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pySDC>`_.
Use

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pySDC

to get the latest stable release including the core dependencies.
Note that this will omit some of the more complex packages not required for the core functionality of `pySDC`, e.g. `mpi4py`, `fenics` and `petsc4py` (see below).
All requirements are listed in the files `requirements.txt <https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_ .
To work with the source files, checkout the code from Github and install the dependencies e.g. by using a `conda <https://conda.io/en/latest/>`_ environment and

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt

To check your installation, run

.. code-block:: bash

   nosetests -v pySDC/tests

You may need to update your ``PYTHONPATH`` by running

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/pySDC/root/folder

in particular if you want to run any of the playgrounds, projects or tutorials.
All ``import`` statements there assume that the `pySDC`'s base directory is part of ``PYTHONPATH``.

Note: When installing `mpi4py`, `fenics` and `petsc4py`, make sure they use the same MPI installation (e.g. MPICH3).
You can achieve this e.g. by

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge mpich petsc4py mpi4py fenics

Most of the code is tested automatically using `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC>`_, so a working version of the installation process can always be found in the `install`-block of the `.travis.yml <https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC/blob/master/.travis.yml>`_ file.

For many examples, `LaTeX` is used for the plots, i.e. a decent installation of this is needed in order to run the tests.
When using `fenics` or `petsc4py`, a C++ compiler is required (although installation may go through at first).

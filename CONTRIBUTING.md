# How to contribute to pySDC

Developments on the `pySDC` code use the classical approach of forks and pull requests.
You can look at [extended GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models) for more details (skip this if you are already used to it). Furthermore, branches on `pySDC` follow a pre-defined structure. To contribute to any of them, please look at the [pull request recommendations](./docs/contrib/01_pull_requests.md).

Additionally, a _few_ rules are set to enforce code readability, consistency and reliability. Some of them are automatically tested with each commit, and summarized in the page on [continuous integration (CI)](./docs/contrib/02_continuous_integration.md).
Others are specific conventions chosen for the pySDC library, that may follow Python standards (or not ...), detailed in the [naming conventions](./docs/contrib/03_naming_conventions.md) page.

Finally, while `pySDC` provides many base functionalities that implement classical flavors of SDC, it also allows problem-specific applications through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the implementation of custom inherited classes.
This follows a specific OOP framework, you can look at the page on [custom implementations](./docs/contrib/04_custom_implementations.md) for more details. Additional guideline are also given on how to [document the code](./docs/contrib/05_documenting_code.md) in `pySDC`.
